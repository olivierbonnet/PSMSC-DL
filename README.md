# PSMSC-DL
Basic implementations of Deep Learning algorithms via the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) package ([Python](https://www.python.org/)). It refers to the courses of Deep Learning of the MSc track *Performance in Software, Media and Scientific Computing* given at [INPT-ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/en/index.html) Eng. School and [Paul Sabatier Faculty](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/home-page-en-379161.kjsp) of Science and Engineering.

## Getting Started
Every folder refers to a neural network class (and a laboratory project). They are all independants and can be run separately:
* fully-connected forward neural networks,
* convolutional neural networks,
* recurrent neural networks,
* etc.

### Prerequisites
You first need to install Anaconda.

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-5.0.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh | sh
```

### Installing
With Anaconda or Miniconda installed, download the following packages:

```
conda install pytorch -c pytorch
conda install pytorchvision
conda install jupyter
conda install pandas
conda install matplotlib
```

## Built With
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The Python Programming Language
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) - An open source deep learning platform that provides a seamless path from research prototyping to production deployment.
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) - An interactive project IDE
